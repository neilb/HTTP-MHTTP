   microhttp and libmhttp

Copyright (c) 2003, Piers Harding. All Rights Reserved.
This module is free software. It may be used, redistributed
and/or modified under the same terms as Perl itself.

this distribution contains a simple command line client for http (microhttp)
and a library version of the same thing (libmhttp)

simply unpack the distribution tar file (microhttp.tgz), change into the mhttp
directory and type "make all".

You may need to adjust the Makefile to suit your flavour of UNIX.


Cheers.
