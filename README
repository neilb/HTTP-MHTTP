HTTP::MHTTP is a fast http client library for Perl.  its advantages are that 
it gives you low level access to constructing the HTTP requests, and it 
handles GET, POST, PUT, HEAD, and DELETE.

The test suite assumes that you have access to the internet - so if the
tests fail then it is most likely due to you not being able to hit
