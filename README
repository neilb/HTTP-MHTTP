HTTP::MHTTP is a fast http client library for Perl.  its advantages are that 
it gives you low level access to constructing the HTTP requests, and it 
handles GET, POST, PUT, HEAD, and DELETE.

Basic SSL support can be compiled in - this does not validate certificates,
but enables the TLS level negotiation.

To compile in SSL support then amend the call to perl Makefile.PL to be:
GOTSSL=yes perl Makefile.PL

You may need to amend the Makefile.PL script to ensure that the CFLAGS, and 
LDFLAGS (INC, and LIBS) are pointing at your openssl installation correctly.

The test suite assumes that you have access to the internet - so if the
tests fail then it is most likely due to you not being able to hit

perl Makefile.PL   <= change this to "GOTSSL=yes perl Makefile.PL" for SSL support
make 
make test
make install
